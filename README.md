# Restaurant Page
A project for The Odin Project's Javascript Course, where we have to build a restaurant webpage using javascript only by generating the entire content of the website with DOM manipulation. We will also build this website with the help of webpack so we can seperate the code into modules each with its own responsibility.  

## Live Demo
https://jordyf15.github.io/restaurant-page/  

## Installation and Usage
Input the following command one-by-one to the terminal.  
```
    git clone https://github.com/jordyf15/restaurant-page.git
    cd restaurant-page
    npm i
```
Just open the index.html in the dist folder with a browser.
